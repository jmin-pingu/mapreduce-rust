# Paper Replication: MapReduce

My personal implementation of [MapReduce](https://research.google/pubs/mapreduce-simplified-data-processing-on-large-clusters/) in Rust.

**Goals**
- Reimplement MapReduce in Rust.
- Allow user-supplied programs that follow the MapReduce API to work at runtime.
- Get comfortable with Rust RPC libraries, specifically [tarpc](https://github.com/google/tarpc).

## Implementation Details


## References

While I have programmed in Rust, building a working system with Rust is a different
story. These references helped immensely in learning and building a working project!
