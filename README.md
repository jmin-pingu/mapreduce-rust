# Paper Replication: MapReduce

My personal implementation of MapReduce in Rust.

**Goals**
- Reimplement MapReduce in Rust.
- Allow user-supplied programs that follow the MapReduce API to work at runtime.
- Get comfortable with Rust RPC libraries, specifically [tarpc](https://github.com/google/tarpc).
